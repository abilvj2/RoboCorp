This project utilizes Robot Framework to extract insurance information from the web, analyze and perform calculations through the robot and and fill clinic softwares and billing PDFs automatically.
An insurance claim is done end to end in this project entirely without human intervention.

## Features

- Web scraping to extract insurance information
- PDF manipulation to fill dentist forms
- Easy-to-use Robot Framework keywords
- Customizable test cases and test data
## Background study

- Studying the cost and estimates of different Cloud APIs to be integrated to the robot.
- Comparing performance and choosing Google Cloud API based on specific use case based testing
- Researched and documented Open Dental software which can be critical in filling applications.
- Amalgamation of different components to work unified with the robot
